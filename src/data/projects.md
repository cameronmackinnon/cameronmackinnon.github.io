# Travel

- I am originally from Halifax, Nova Scotia. I lived in Kingston for five years for university and now I am going on my third year in Toronto. 
- In my third year of university, I spent a semester abroad at NTU in Singapore. During my 4 months of "studying", I spent a total of 30 days travelling outside of Singapore. I visited Malaysia twice, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. 
- Following Singapore, I spent the summer in Jasper, AB, working at a bakery and hiking on the weekends.
- I have travelled to all of the provinces except for Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and 0/3 Territories, although they are high on my bucket list.  
- In the US, I have been to Maine, Boston, NYC, Colorado, San Diego & Joshua Tree, and Florida
- Most recently I have been to Colombia and Costa Rica
